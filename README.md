# REST API Using Node JS Express and MongoDB.


Note: node_modules will be zipped as there was lots of files and git was not allowing more than 100 thus i have zipped that.


This project can bee downloaded as it is and can be open in Netbeans IDE and use the following postman API call with required example input  "BookRESTAPI.postman_collection" to test the same.

We can perform CRUD operation properly using the same program.

I have one demo video which will be in the following drive location to see how we can use the same.
